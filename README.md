    <h6>Minestom library used to generate different shapes of particle effect</h6>

----

</div>

ParticleLib is a Minestom library based on a Bukkit Plugin [ParticleLib](https://github.com/602723113/ParticleLib).

It is capable of 
1. generating different shapes of particle effect.
2. generating particle effect using math equations.
3. performing Matrix transformation on the particle effect.
4. premade common particle effect(like lotus,wings).

Currently, it just works but does not perfectly integrate with Minestom (mostly due to the difference on Scheduler).
